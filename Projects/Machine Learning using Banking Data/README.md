# Machine Learning using Banking Data

The primary objective of the first part of this project is to develop a predictive model that categorizes clients into two groups - those who will purchase the new product and those who won't. 
To accomplish this, three distinct classification techniques will be employed and the best performing method will be selected by comparing their results.

In the second part of the assignment, a portion of the provided dataset will be utilized.
More specifically the variables related to clients.
Some potential clusters among the clients will be identified. 
After the clustering process, the relationship between the clustered clients and their subscription status to the product will be ivestigated.
