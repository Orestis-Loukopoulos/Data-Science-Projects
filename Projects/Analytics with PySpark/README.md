# Background

This repository contains the solutions for the Spark Assignment of the MSc in Business Analytics program, specifically for the course "Big Data Systems." The assignment focuses on using Apache Spark, with a focus on PySpark, to analyze a dataset of book metadata and derive insights to optimize sales for a small bookstore company.

## Assignment Details

- Program: MSc in Business Analytics
- Course: Big Data Systems
- Deadline: Friday, April 1st, 2022, 23:59

## Task 1 [50 points]

Your first task is to explore the dataset. You need to use SparkSQL with DataFrames in a Jupyter notebook that delivers the following:

- It uses the `json()` function to load the dataset.
- It counts and displays the number of books in the database.
- It counts and displays the number of e-books in the database (based on the "is_ebook" field).
- It uses the `summary()` command to display basic statistics about the "average_rating" field.
- It uses the `groupby()` and `count()` commands to display all distinct values in the "format" field and their number of appearances.

Your deliverable should be a ready-to-run Jupyter notebook named `id-t1.ipynb`, containing your details (name, id) and explanations for each step of the code.

## Task 2 [30 points]

For this task, you continue to work with SparkSQL. This time, you need to provide a Jupyter notebook (again using PySpark and DataFrames) that delivers the following:

- It returns the "book_id" and "title" of the book with the largest "average_rating" that its title starts with the first letter of your last name.
- It returns the average "average_rating" of the books that their title starts with the second letter of your last name.
- It returns the "book_id" and "title" of the Paperback book with the most pages when only books with titles starting with the third letter of your last name are considered.

Your deliverable should be a ready-to-run Jupyter notebook named `id-t2.ipynb`, containing your details (name, id) and explanations for each step of the code.

## Task 3 [20 points]

As a final task, your supervisor assigned you to investigate if it is possible to train a linear regression model (using the `LinearRegression()` function) that could predict the "average_rating" of a book. The input for the model should include the following features: "language_code," "num_pages," "ratings_count," and "publication year." You should use Python and DataFrames, this time with MLlib.

Your code should:

- Prepare the feature vectors.
- Prepare the training and testing datasets with a 70%-30% split.
- Train the model.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model based on the Rsquared metric and display the corresponding metric on the screen.
