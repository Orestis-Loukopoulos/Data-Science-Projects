# Problem Description
Consider a central repository (Node with id: 0) and a set of n = 300 customers (Nodes with id: 1,..,n=300). All nodes are in a square of side size-100. The transition time from node to node is equal to the Euclidean distance between two nodes. Each customer has a required service time and a profit. A fleet of 5 vehicles is located in the central warehouse. The vehicles start from the warehouse, serve the customers and return to the central warehouse. Each vehicle conducts one route. Each customer must be covered (not necessarily) by a single vehicle visit. In this case, the customer bestows their profit to the route. The total time of each route cannot exceed 150 time units. The scope of the problem is to design a 5-route schedule that maximizes the total profit.
