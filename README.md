# MSc-Business-Analytics

During my Master's degree in Business Analytics, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects that helped me to gain hands-on experience in the field of Data Analytics and Data Science. These projects involved using data to solve business problems. Various tools and techniques were used to analyze and interpret the data. Through these projects, I  learned about data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and other relevant areas in business analytics. By working on these projects, I developed my skills in using data to inform business decisions and drive insights.
